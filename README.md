Light/Dark Harmony for Modern Web Apps

A high-performance, accessibility-first UI library built with cutting-edge CSS, designed to work seamlessly across React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and vanilla Web Components. Prioritizes GPU-efficient rendering, adaptive contrast, and zero-runtime overhead through:

âœ¨ Auto-Enforced Accessibility
ðŸš€ Container Query-Driven Responsiveness
ðŸŽ¨ Three Master Themes: Tenebrism (high contrast), Sfumato (soft blend), Umbra (deep shadows)
ðŸŒ“ Dynamic Light/Dark Mode with CSS Color Level 4 (OKLCH)
ðŸ“¦ 2.8kb Core (CSS) + 1.2kb Framework Adapters

Well, that's the intention, at least. Let's see how far I get!
